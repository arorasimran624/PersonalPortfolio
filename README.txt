This is my project named "PERSONAL PORTFOLIO".

This project is made with the help of HTML,CSS and Javascript.

This project contains a HTML file for structuring the portfolio.
Then,it contains a CSS file for styling,designing and animations.
And in last a Javascript file for its functioning.

When you will open MY PORTFOLIO you will see a landing page describing about
me.There is a navbar present over there so you can move to different areas
for viewing about me,my skills and my projects

When you click on About,you will move to about and you can view my education,
hobbies and interests over there.

When you click on Services,you will see my skills over there.
When you click on Portfolio,you can see my projects.
When you click on Contact,you will view a contact page from where you
can contact me.

This portfolio is responsive and have transition for smooth experience of user.
The contact form have validation which I have applied throw Javascript so that 
user cannot enter wrong information.You will see a alert msg,if you enter anything 
incorrect.
